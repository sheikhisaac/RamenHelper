# RamenHelper
This is a simple recipe skill for Amazon Alexa to help you make the perfect bowl of ramen.

Ramen Helper was created using Amazon's Lambda Management Console and their Developer Console.  It is primarily written in Node.js and allows the user to ask Alexa for tips throughout the preparation and consumption of ramen noodles.

Ramen Helper implements 4 intents: Amazon.CancelIntent, Amazon.HelpIntent, Amazon.StopIntent, and GetNewRamenTip, along with 15 sample utterances to allow for a range of accessibility.
